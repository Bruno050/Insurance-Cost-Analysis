# **Linera Regression Project: Insurance Cost Analysis**

In this project, i will perform analytics operations on an insurance database that uses the below mentioned parameters.
The dataset <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/medical-insurance-price-prediction?resource=download'>is here</a> on Kaggle

| Parameter |Description| Content type |
|---|----|---|
|age| Age in years| integer |
|gender| Female or Male|integer (1 or 2)|
| bmi | Body mass index | float |
|no_of_children| Number of children | integer|
|smoker| Whether smoker or not | integer (0 or 1)|
|region| Which US region - NW, NE, SW, SE | integer (1,2,3 or 4 respectively)| 
|charges| Annual Insurance charges in USD | float|

## Objectives 
In this project, i will:
 - Load the data as a `pandas` dataframe
 - Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
 - Run exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identify the attributes that most affect the `charges`
 - Develop single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the `charges`
 - Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models. 

## SKILLS
In this project, i used a Machine Learning Model to predict the price of a house based on some features of the dataset.
This project is a concrete situtaion that i use a Linear Regression Model.
